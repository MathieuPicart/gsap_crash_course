## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

A comprehensive crash course project demonstrating advanced GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) techniques in React. This project showcases various animation patterns including scroll-triggered animations, text splitting effects, and responsive animations using GSAP's powerful plugin ecosystem.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[React 19](https://react.dev/)** is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The latest version brings enhanced performance, improved hooks, and better developer experience for creating interactive web applications.

- **[GSAP](https://gsap.com/)** (GreenSock Animation Platform) is the industry-standard JavaScript animation library trusted by major brands. It provides high-performance animations with an intuitive API, making it easy to create stunning timeline-based and scroll-triggered animations.

- **[@gsap/react](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/React/)** is the official React wrapper for GSAP that provides React-specific hooks and utilities, enabling seamless integration of GSAP animations with React's component lifecycle.

- **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** is a next-generation frontend build tool that provides lightning-fast development experience with instant hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to quickly build custom user interfaces with minimal custom CSS. It promotes consistency, responsiveness, and faster styling without leaving the HTML.

- **[react-responsive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive)** is a React library that makes it easy to implement responsive designs by providing hooks to detect media queries and render components conditionally based on screen size.
